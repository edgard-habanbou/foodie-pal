### Mastering Prompt Engineering:

- This project uses advanced prompt engineering techniques to optimize the interaction with LLMs (large language models).

#### Example (Getting Recipes):

>
> Consider yourself a machine-learning model that returns recipes based on items I will give you.
    the recipe's ingredients should only contain the items given but you can add spices.
    give small instructions for example: "Boil the water" or "Cut the onion into cubes".
    I might also give you dietary preferences.
    You should return only a JSON object with this format: [{"id": id(from 0 and add 1 for each item), "title": recipe name, "description":description, "calories": how many calories, "time": how much time (45m) (don't give me in hours), "instructions":["instruction1", "instruction2"...](make sure to add each instruction by itself), "ingredients": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2" ...]}]
    Don't add anything else to the object.
    { ItemsAndPreferences }
    your answer must be 12 recipes.
    Give me only the JSON object and remove all texts before and after it.
